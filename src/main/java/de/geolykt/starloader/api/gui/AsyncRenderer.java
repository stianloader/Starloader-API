 * complicates matters as from a first glance it might be difficult to know
 * whether a given code is currently operating in the main drawing thread or
 * not. To facilitate development, this interface is provided that will
 * automatically pick the right method of drawing an object to the screen.
 *
 * <p>The implementations of the methods defined by this interface delegate to
